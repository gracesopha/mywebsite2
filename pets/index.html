                <h2>Luna</h2>
                    <p>
                        My dog is a chihuahua-papillion that my family adopted about six years ago.
                        She is currently seven years old and is the first dog I've ever had!
                        Though, she is very anti-social and only enjoys playing with cats.
                    </p>
                <h2>Aiko</h2>
                    <p>
                        Aiko was the second addition to the family. She was easily accepted by Luna as her new best friend.
                        Aiko and Luna both have a tendency to dislike people, so they get along well.
                        Funnily enough, both our pets have a third eye mark on their forehead and are three different colors
                        , which is a sign of good luck!
